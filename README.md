Blog Project

The Blog Project is a website I created while learning Flask, Bootstrap, and Jinja through Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp." It's a simple blog where you can read posts, contact me, and find links to my social media profiles. It's a great way to practice web development skills and showcase what I've learned.


## Features

- Responsive Design: 
The blog is designed to adapt to various screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Multiple Posts: 
The blog includes multiple posts covering a range of topics. Users can navigate through these posts to find information, insights, or entertainment.
- Social Media Integration: 
Links to my social media profiles are provided, enabling users to connect with me on different platforms and stay updated on my latest content and activities.
- Contact Form: 
Integration of a contact form allows visitors to easily get in touch with me. This feature enhances user engagement and facilitates communication.
